# Zomato Analytics CLI

Zomato Analytics is a CLI tool that fetches orders from your Zomato account and displays basic stats like expenditure per month, weekday wise distribution and more. 

## Security 

The CLI will ask for your email address and password. This is needed for fetching details from your account. None of the sensitive data is stored or sent anywhere other than Zomato's official servers. Complete source code is open and available here for verification.
